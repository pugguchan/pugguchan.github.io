      <h3>Education</h3>
      In 2020, I obtained my high school diploma from Stissing Mountain Jr/Sr High School. That following Autumn I started taking courses at Dutchess Community College, and I graduated with an Associate's Degree in General Studies in the winter of 2021. The following Spring of 2022 I began my coursework at SUNY New Paltz, where I will be graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in Spring of 2024.

    <h3>Plan for the Future</h3>
    Once I graduate from New Paltz, I plan on entering the computer science industry as either a software developer, or as a video game designer. I've always been interested in video game design as I have played video games since I was younger, and they have always been a big part of my life.
